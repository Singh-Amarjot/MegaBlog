MegaBlog – Blog Management Web Application (Beta Version)

MegaBlog is a modern, single-page blog management web application developed as a beta client project during my work at Gitstein Technologies. The application focuses on content creation, authentication, and state-managed UI using contemporary frontend technologies.

🔹 Core Functionalities & Technologies Used
1. User Authentication & Backend Integration

Integrated Appwrite as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) solution.

Implemented secure user authentication (sign-up, login, logout).

Managed user sessions and access control for protected routes.

Enabled CRUD operations on blog posts through Appwrite’s database and storage services.

2. Rich Text Content Creation

Used TinyMCE Rich Text Editor for creating and editing blog posts.

Allowed users to format content with headings, links, images, and styled text.

Stored rich HTML content safely and rendered it dynamically.

3. State Management

Implemented Redux Toolkit for global state management.

Managed authentication state, user data, and blog data efficiently.

Ensured predictable state updates and improved scalability.

4. Form Handling & Validation

Used React Hook Form for optimized form handling.

Implemented validation for inputs such as titles, content, and user credentials.

Improved performance by minimizing re-renders during form interactions.

5. Routing & Navigation

Used React Router DOM to create a seamless single-page application experience.

Implemented protected routes to restrict unauthorized access.

Enabled smooth navigation between login, dashboard, post editor, and blog pages.

6. Dynamic Content Rendering

Used html-react-parser to safely render stored HTML blog content.

Ensured correct display of formatted articles without security risks.

7. Responsive UI & Styling

Styled the application using Tailwind CSS.

Built a fully responsive layout adaptable to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Applied utility-first CSS for rapid UI development and consistency.

8. Modern Development Tooling

Used Vite for fast development and optimized production builds.

Followed ESLint rules for clean, maintainable, and error-free code.

Modular React component architecture for reusability and scalability.
